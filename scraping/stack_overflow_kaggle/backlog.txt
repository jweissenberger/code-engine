Backlog for kaggle dataset

- need to make sure that every example is executatble (only add examples that can be executed)
- modify code blocks to check which lines are executable or not
    - many have examples that start with >>> or just have the response directly in the code block
    - these obviously couldn't be executed and shouldn't be added
- would be much easier to use the other dataset that we know is executable
